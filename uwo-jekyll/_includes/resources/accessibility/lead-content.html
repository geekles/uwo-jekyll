<h1 class="news-heading">Accessibility</h1>

<p class="drop-down-nav">
  We have undertaken to use our knowledge and understanding of the ways in which different people access the Internet, to develop a web site that is clear and simple for everybody to use.
</p>


<h4>Validation</h4>
<p class="drop-down-nav">
  We have used <acronym title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML5</acronym> and <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS3</acronym> that conforms to specification, as laid out by the W3C because we believe that usability and accessibility must have a solid foundation. If anything on this web site does not validate correctly, please contact the <a href="http://www.uwosh.edu/about-uw-oshkosh/feedback.html">Site Administration</a>.
</p>
<p class="drop-down-nav">
  We have also endeavoured to achieve AA accessibility as measured against version 1.0 of the <acronym title="Web Content Accessbility Guidelines">WCAG</acronym>. We are aware however, that a number of the checkpoints of the <acronym title="Web Content Accessbility Guidelines">WCAG</acronym> are subjective &mdash; and although we are sure that we have met them squarely, there may be instances where interpretation may vary.

<p class="drop-down-nav"><strong>Cookies</strong></p>

<p class="drop-down-nav">Our website may place a &quot;cookie&quot; on your computer, unless your browser is set to reject cookies. Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer (unless you block them). We use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits and compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. The cookie information placed on your computer could include the following: IP address, browser type, operating system, the date and time, whether or not you have visited a website before, where you went when you visited that website, and any preferences or customization that you might have set (including username and passwords).</p>

<p class="drop-down-nav">HOW WE USE THE COLLECTED INFORMATION</p>

<p class="drop-down-nav"><strong>Client Information</strong></p>

<p class="drop-down-nav">Client information is used to route the requested Web page to your computer for viewing. We send the requested Web page and the routing information to our Internet service provider or other entities involved in transmitting the requested page to you. We do not control the privacy practices of those entities.</p>

<p class="drop-down-nav">We may keep your information indefinitely after the Web page is transmitted, but do not try to obtain any information to link it to the individuals who browse our website. However, on rare occasions when a &quot;hacker&quot; attempts to breach computer security, logs of routing information are retained to permit a security investigation, and in such cases may be forwarded together with any other relevant information in our possession to law enforcement agencies. We use this transaction routing information primarily in a statistical summary type format to assess site content and server performance. We may share this summary information with our business partners when needed.</p>

<p class="drop-down-nav">Under the Wisconsin Freedom of Information Act, records in our possession at the time of a Freedom of Information Act Request might be subject to inspection by or disclosure to members of the public. As indicated above, client information may be retained after transmission of the requested Web page and might be available for inspection.</p>

<p class="drop-down-nav"><strong>Essential and nonessential technical information</strong></p>

<p class="drop-down-nav">Essential and nonessential technical information lets us respond to your request in an appropriate format [or in a personalized manner] and helps us plan website improvements. To expedite this process, some official UW Oshkosh websites use &quot;cookies.&quot; Usually a cookie enables the University website to tailor what you see according to the way you entered the site (i.e., if you entered by pushing a button identifying yourself as a student, your subsequent views of information might be tailored for student audiences).</p>

<p class="drop-down-nav">We also use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website. For example, we may determine that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, but we do not disclose information that could identify those specific individuals.</p>

<p class="drop-down-nav">Most UW Oshkosh sites use Google Analytics or similar services to analyze Web traffic for design and content purposes. In such cases, the access information described above may be shared with the vendor(s) providing the analytical service. UW Oshkosh does not control the privacy policies of these vendors.</p>

<p class="drop-down-nav"><strong>Optional information</strong></p>

<p class="drop-down-nav">Optional information enables us to provide services or information tailored more specifically to your needs, to forward your message or inquiry to another entity that is better able to do so, and to plan website improvements.</p>

<p class="drop-down-nav">We use the information you provide about yourself or about someone else when placing a request for service only to complete that order or request. We do not share this information with outside parties, except to the extent necessary to complete that order or request.</p>

<p class="drop-down-nav">We generally use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. By state policy, such addresses are not shared with outside parties.</p>

<p class="drop-down-nav">Finally, we never use or share the optional information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the purpose described without a clear notice on the particular site and without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.</p>

<p class="drop-down-nav"><strong>EMAIL SUBSCRIPTIONS</strong></p>

<p class="drop-down-nav">Several UW Oshkosh departments and units allow you to subscribe online, and receive the email newsletters and event updates. If you no longer wish to receive these email, follow the &quot;unsubscribe&quot; instructions located near the bottom of each email.</p>

<p class="drop-down-nav">If you send us email messages, you should be aware that information disclosed in email may not be secure or encrypted and thus may be available to others. We suggest that you exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal or confidential information in email. We will use your email address to respond directly to your questions or comments.</p>

<p class="drop-down-nav"><strong>EMAIL POLICY</strong></p>

<p class="drop-down-nav">We will not share, sell, rent, swap or authorize any third party to use your email address for commercial purposes without your permission.</p>

<p class="drop-down-nav">THE CHOICE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION</p>

<p class="drop-down-nav">There is no legal requirement for you to provide any information at our website. However, our website will not work without client information and the essential technical information. Failure of your browser to provide nonessential technical information will not prevent your use of our website but may prevent certain features from working. For any optional information that is requested at the website, failure to provide the requested information will mean that the particular feature or service associated with that part of the Web page may not be available to you.</p>

<p class="drop-down-nav">INQUIRIES</p>

<p class="drop-down-nav">Should you have other questions or concerns about the UW Oshkosh Internet Privacy Statement and our privacy practices, please send us an email at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:webrequests@uwosh.edu">webrequests@uwosh.edu</a>. If you wish to review or change information gathered about you through an official UW Oshkosh website but you do not know how, the University webmaster will assist in locating the persons responsible for that site so that you may make your request directly to them.</p>

<p class="drop-down-nav"><strong>CHANGES TO THIS POLICY</strong></p>

<p class="drop-down-nav">This Privacy Policy may be amended from time to time. Any such changes will be posted on this page. The effective date of this policy was October 16, 2012.</p>
