      <a href="#liberal"><i class="fa fa-chevron-down clickable"></i>The University embraces the following definition of liberal education:</a>
      <div id="liberal" class="content">
        Liberal education is a philosophy of education that empowers individuals with broad knowledge and transferable skills, and a strong sense of values, ethics, and civic engagement.  These broad goals have been enduring even as the courses and requirements that comprise a liberal education have changed over the years.  Characterized by challenging encounters with important and relevant issues today and throughout history, a liberal education prepares graduates both for socially valued work and for civic leadership in their society. It usually includes a general education curriculum that provides broad exposure to multiple disciplines and ways of knowing, along with more in-depth study in at least one field or area of concentration.<br>
