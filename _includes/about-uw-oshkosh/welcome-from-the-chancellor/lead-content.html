  Our commitment to engagement, collaboration and &ldquo;green&rdquo; environmental principles guides our strategic and operational planning, while our dedication to liberal education reform, student success services, faculty development, sustainability and integrated marketing and communications makes our academic community distinct. The opportunity our students have to work directly with faculty on state-of-the-art research projects that benefit the community distinguishes an education at the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh. A newspaper editorial entitled &ldquo;UW-Oshkosh gaining national reputation for research, teaching&rdquo; noted that &ldquo;UW-O emphasizes researchers having classroom contact with students,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;it has learned how to carve out niches of excellence knowing full well that those new branches of research earn it a reputation for innovation.&rdquo;
