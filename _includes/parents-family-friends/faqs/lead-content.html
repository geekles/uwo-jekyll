    <a href="#insurance"><i class="fa fa-chevron-down clickable"></i> Is there health insurance available for students on campus?</a>
    <div id="insurance" class="content">
      <p class="drop-down-nav text-justify">
        The <a href="http://www.uwosh.edu/health_center">Student Health Center</a> does not bill insurance, other than the Family Planning Waiver. However, upon request, students are able to obtain a copy of their receipt with the proper information to enable them to submit the charges to their insurance company for reimbursement.
      </p>
      <p class="drop-down-nav text-justify">
        It is important for students to carry a copy of their health insurance card. Many insurance companies will only cover the cost of care at specific hospitals/clinics. If students require x-rays or specialty care, it is important that they know where care will be covered.
      </p>
      <p class="drop-down-nav text-justify">
        We recommend that all students have health insurance coverage. If they are not covered by your plan or if your plan does not cover them while away at college, UW System has made available a quality, <a href="http://www.uwosh.edu/health_center/billing">comprehensive plan</a> to consider. The plan description is available from Student Assurance Services at <a href="http://www.sas-mn.com" target="_blank">www.sas-mn.com</a> (under colleges click on "Look Up School" and select University of Wisconsin Oshkosh).

    <a href="#roommateIssue"><i class="fa fa-chevron-down clickable"></i> Who can I refer my son or daughter to, if there is an issue with his or her roommate?</a>
    <div id="roommateIssue" class="content">
      <p class="drop-down-nav text-justify">
        Roommate issues often are a part of the college experience. The first step in resolving roommate issues usually begins with the two students sitting down to try to work things out. It is encouraged that all roommates fill out a roommate agreement at the beginning of the year. This document provides students with guidelines for discussing matters that sometimes become issues for roommates, such as cleaning, guests or use of each other's property. Students are able to get copies of the roommate agreement from their Community Adviser (<acronym title="Community Adviser">CA</acronym>) or Residence Hall Director (<acronym title="Residence Hall Director">RHD</acronym>). If the two students are unable to reach an agreement on their own, there are <acronym title="Community Advisers">CAs</acronym> on every floor who have been trained in mediation. Every building also has a <acronym title="Residence Hall Director">RHD</acronym>, a professional staff member, who generally has a master's degree in higher education, counseling or related field.
